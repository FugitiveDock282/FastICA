# FastICA For SS4202 Term Paper
Code written for a course's (SS4202) term paper at IISER-K.

Involves using the FastICA (Independent Component Analysis) algorithm for determination of independent components in the [magnetometers' signal from the Quasi-Zenith Satellite](https://sees.tksc.jaxa.jp/fw/dfw/SEES/English/Papers/data/2020/peer_reviewed/01/2020_reviewed_01.shtml) to try and denoise the signal.

The approach mirrors that of a paper by [Imajo et al.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2020JA028790).
